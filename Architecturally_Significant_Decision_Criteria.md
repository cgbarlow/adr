# Criteria for an Architecturally Significant Decision

All strategic or significant architecture decisions must be presented for approval to the authorised decision maker or decision body. 

Engage for approval where a decision meets any one of the following criteria: 

1. **Hard-to-Change**: Difficult to undo or reverse, with high strategic impact and implications. (If a change is easy to undo and brings immediate benefit, governance consideration may not be needed). 
2. **New**: Innovative or significantly different from established guardrails, or leverages a new capability for the first time. 
3. **Not Strategically Aligned**: The change deviates from approved strategies and guardrails, such as:
    - extending the life of an assets intended for retirement
    - significantly customising solutions beyond their original purpose
    - creating duplicate or competing alternatives to existing approved solutions
    - deviating from existing guardrails or there is no applicable guardrail
4. **Risk**: Involves significant technology-related risk.
5. **Budget/Delivery/Benefits**: Aligns with guardrails but has substantial financial, delivery, or benefit realisation implications that need wider consideration.
6. **Requested**: Requires a discussion or decision paper as requested by the authorised governance body due to potential impacts related to any of the above criteria.
